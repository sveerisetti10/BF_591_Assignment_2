#### Bioconductor ####
# it is standard among R packages to define libraries and packages at the 
# beginning of a script. Also note that a package should NOT be installed every 
# time a script runs.
# The bioconductor repository has installation instructions for biomaRt: 
# https://bioconductor.org/install/

#### Loading and processing data ####
#' Load Expression Data
#'
#' @param filepath A text string of the full filepath to the file to load.
#'
#' @return A tibble containing the data loaded from the CSV in `filepath`. 
#' 
#' @details Note that not all CSVs are created equal, and there are often cases where 
#' the data will not load in correctly on the first try. You may want to write this functon to 
#' adjust the CSV file being loaded into this assignment so that it can be formed into a 
#' tibble correctly.
#'
#' @examples 
#' `data <- load_expression('/project/bf528/project_1/data/example_intensity_data.csv')`
load_expression <- function(filepath) {
  return(NULL)
}

#' Filter 15% of the gene expression values.
#'
#' @param tibble A tibble of expression values, rows by probe and columns by sample.
#'
#' @return A tibble of affymetrix probe names from the input expression data tibble. 
#' These names match the rows with 15% or more of the expression values about log2(15).
#' 
#' @details This is similar to the filters being implemented in BF528's project 1. 
#' We do not necessarily want to capture all parts of the assay in our analysis, so 
#' filters like this serve to reduce the noise and amount of data to examine.
#'
#' @examples `samples <- filter_15(data_tib)`
#' `> str(samples)`
#' `tibble [40,158 × 1] (S3: tbl_df/tbl/data.frame)`
#' `$ probeids: chr [1:40158] "1007_s_at" "1053_at" "117_at" "121_at" ...`
filter_15 <- function(tibble){
  return()
}

#### Gene name conversion ####

#' Convert affymetrix array names into hgnc_symbol IDs using biomaRt. Inputs and 
#' outputs will likely not be the same size.
#'
#' @param affy_tib A single column tibble of strings containing array names.
#'
#' @return A 2 column tibble that contains affy IDs in the first column,
#' and their corresponding HGNC gene ID in the second column. Note that not all affy IDs 
#' will necessarily correspond with a gene ID, and one gene may have multiple affy IDs.
#' 
#' @details Connecting to ensembl via biomaRt can be...hit or miss...so you may 
#' want to check if data was correctly returned (or if it was just empty). The 
#' `getBM()` function may not accept a tibble, so you might need to convert your 
#' input into a flat vector.
#'
#' @examples 
#' `> affy_to_hgnc(tibble(c('202860_at', '1553551_s_at')))`
#' `affy_hg_u133_plus_2 hgnc_symbol`
#' `1        1553551_s_at      MT-ND1`
#' `2        1553551_s_at       MT-TI`
#' `3        1553551_s_at       MT-TM`
#' `4        1553551_s_at      MT-ND2`
#' `5           202860_at     DENND4B`
affy_to_hgnc <- function(affy_vector) {
  return()
}

#### ggplot ####

#' Reduce a tibble of expression data to only the rows in good_genes or bad_genes.
#'
#' @param expr_tibble A tibble holding the expression data, each row corresponding to
#' one affymetrix probe ID and each column to a sample.
#' @param names_ids A two column tibble that associates affy IDs with HGNC gene IDs. 
#' Generated `with affy_to_hgnc()`.
#' @param good_genes A list of gene names stored as a vector of strings.
#' @param bad_genes A list of gene names stored as a vector of strings.
#'
#' @return A tibble with two additional columns added:
#' 1. HGNC gene IDs 
#' 2. Does the gene is this row fall into "good" or "bad" genes?
#' This tibble should be reduced to only rows present in good or bad genes. All
#' other rows can be discarded.
#' 
#' @details In order to plot only our genes of interest, we need to rearrange our 
#' data to include only the elements we want to see. We also want to add to columns, 
#' one that associates the probeids with the HGNC gene name, and one that says if 
#' that gene is in the good or bad sets of genes.
#'
#' @examples 
#' `plot_tibble <- reduce_data(expr_tibble = expr, names_ids = sample_names,`
#' `                           goodGenes, badGenes)`
#' `> head(plot_tibble)`
#' `A tibble: 6 × 38`
#' `  probeids    hgnc    gene_set    GSM972389 ...`
#' `  <chr>       <chr>   <chr>       <dbl>     ...`
#' `1 202860_at   DENND4B good        7.16      ...`
#' `2 204340_at   TMEM187 good        6.40      ...`
reduce_data <- function(expr_tibble, names_ids, good_genes, bad_genes){
  return()
}

#' Plot a boxplot of good and bad genes.
#'
#' @param tibble A reduced tibble of expression data, with information about
#' good and bad genes and gene names.
#'
#' @return A ggplot object which contains a boxplot of the genes and samples we 
#' are interested in.
#' 
#' @details This function performs one additional step before using `ggplot()`: 
#' converting the _wide_ format of the input tibble to a _long_ format.
#'
#' @examples `p <- plot_ggplot(plot_tibble)`
plot_ggplot <- function(tibble) {
  return()
}
